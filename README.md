# What

Jailbreak tool for Control4 3.1.0 - allowing add/rename/move rooms/drivers/devices without being a dealer.

# Why

I'm a nerd. I got home automation in my house so I could play with it, so I could write my own drivers and make it do cool stuff. By default you can't do that without being an authorized dealer - unless you jailbreak your Director.

There are a few dodgy tools floating around that achieve the same thing, but the process is over-complicated, error prone and out of date.

I thought it would be safer/easier in the long run to write something open source.

# How

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/garrynewman/Control4.Jailbreak/releases) and download the zip (not the source). Unzip and run C4Jailbreak.exe.

# Other stuff

Everything is at your own risk, obviously. If this tool leads to your house burning down you can't blame me.

To Control4 - please don't be angry at this tool. I love my control4 automated house and would spend a ton more time and money with you guys if I didn't have to do it through a dealer every time. If you want to contact me I'm at garrynewman@gmail.com <3
